## Programming Assignments
### Module 2 - Critical Thinking: Predicting Video Game Preferences with KNN
- For your assignment, you will build a KNN classifier in Python.
### Module 3 - Critical Thinking: Simple Linear Regression in Scikit Learn
- For your assignment, you will build a linear regression model in Python. The Boston housing dataset can be loaded in scikit-learn using the command load_boston ( ) after from sklearn.datasets import load_boston.
### Module 5 - Critical Thinking: Text Dataset Augmentation
- For your assignment, submit a Python script that will take any text dataset and augment it in some way to expand the dataset. Submission must include a script that will augment any text dataset within its folder. Please include the un-augmented dataset with the augmented dataset and a short description of what was augmented.
