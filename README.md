## Programming Assignments
### Module 2 - Critical Thinking: Predicting Video Game Preferences with KNN
- For your assignment, you will build a KNN classifier in Python.
### Module 3 - Critical Thinking: Simple Linear Regression in Scikit Learn
- For your assignment, you will build a linear regression model in Python. The Boston housing dataset can be loaded in scikit-learn using the command load_boston ( ) after from sklearn.datasets import load_boston.
### Module 4 - Critical Thinking: Build a Tensorflow Demo
- The purpose of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience running a Tensorflow model and demonstrate the ability to use the tools and documentation available.
### Module 5 - Critical Thinking: Text Dataset Augmentation
- For your assignment, submit a Python script that will take any text dataset and augment it in some way to expand the dataset. Submission must include a script that will augment any text dataset within its folder. Please include the un-augmented dataset with the augmented dataset and a short description of what was augmented.
## Portfolio Project: ML Agents Project Final Version
- Please submit your final ML Agents project in the form of either an executable file demonstrating the scenario, or a video or link to a video demonstration of your ML Agents scenario. Your agents must meet the following conditions:
- Your agents must estimate outputs necessary to meet the stated goal.
- They must deal with an alterable, changeable environment of some kind. They shouldn't be trained or operate in a static environment.
